Doc. No. 13. 304

EXAMINER’S REPORT.

\

In addition to the testimony of Mr. Higgins, I have that of Mr. Parsons of No. 64 Wall
street, who was well acquainted with claimant, and certiﬁes to his highly respectable charac-
ter, and the entire reliability of his statement. From their lznowle" ge of his losses, they re-
gard the charges in his schedule as very moderate. I do not question his right to the amount

allowed.
EDWARD SANFORD.

TESTIMONY OF ANDR CW F. HIGGINS.

ANDREW F. HIGGINS, being sworn, says: The above-named claimant is my brother in

law ; Mr. Seleninoﬁ’ was compelled to leave the country for Prussia suddenly, in consequence of 

receiving the appointment of Engineer in Chief of the Prussian Navy, and being called home
for immediate duty, and was accompanied by his wife and family; himself a11d wife were
boarders at Mrs. Sumner’s at the time of the riot in July last; I am familiar with everything
Mr. and Mrs. Seleninoﬁ‘ had, and know the articles enumerated in his claim were lost and never
recovered; I know that Mr. Seleninoﬁ" bought the suit of furniture charged at four hundred

two years, and had been re-covered last winter ; the library consisted principally of scientiﬁc
works relating to his profession, and I am certain that the value as stated is less than what
they lost him ; I would state that the number of Mr. Seleninofi"s family wasfour—hi1nself,
wife, baby, and servant—an:l occupied three rooms; curtains (reps, silk and wool) ; mantel-
ornaments and clock ; the clock was black marble ; two bronze figures ; three fancy pieces;
pair of French enameled vases ; the prices put down for the silver was just what was paid for‘
it three years before ; the camelshair shawl was a present from Mr. Seleninoﬁ‘ to his wife at
their wedding ; 1 am conﬁdent. that he has put the price down below its value ; the set of sable
furs were purch sed a year ago, and the price as charged was paid (three-quarter cape) ; I
know that they were very well provided with everything comfortable and nice, in fact costly ;
I think that Mr. Seleninoﬂ‘ did not charge for the articles within one third of their true value;

I know that they lost everything except what he had on at the time and a few things that his  ‘

wife had at the watering-place ; he occupied the room over the diningroom in Mrs. Sumner’s

house ; the house was completely destroyed by ﬁre. ,
