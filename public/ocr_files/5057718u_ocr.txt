EXAM.INER’S REPORT.

RACHAEL MARTIN claims ﬁfty—four dollars and ﬁfty cents. She resided at N o. 13 York street,
in the basement. That portion of the house was attacked, and all the Windows broken, and a
number of stones thrown in the room. She lost, no doubt, the articles in her list, but upon
questioning her she acknowledges that the prices might be more than they were worth ; she
will be well satisﬁed with forty dollars, and I would recommend that. amount be allowed her.
