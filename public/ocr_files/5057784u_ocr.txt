the riot; I kept a lagerbeer-saloon there; I lived next door to the saloon N o. 140 ; I looked out-
of the window and saw the mob coming; it was between half-past ten and twelve o’clock
at night ; I saw them break open the doors and go in the saloon ; took every thing out; there
was a great crowd of them; they left nothing in the saloon ; had kept the saloonthere about
four years; I had a piano in the saloon; it belonged to Mr. Perry, in Broadway; I have no
claim for that; the piano was cut with an axe, and broken to pieces; I lost all the things
enumerated in the list; have not got back any of them since; I bought my liquors of Mr.
Bermeister, N o. 52 New Bowery, and Mr. Baldy, No. 200 Broadway ; I think I bought two of
the baskets of champagne of Baldy, and one of Bermeister; buy cigars of those men some-
times; I occupied four rooms besides the saloon, at No. 138 Greenwich street; I lived next
